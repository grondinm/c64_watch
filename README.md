# C64 Watch

C64 Watch is a customized T-Watch 2020 that was inspired by the Commodore 64 computer.  It features a C64 theme and a built in BASIC interpreter.

## How It Works

I've had a T-Watch 2020 for about a year and haven't found any pre-built software for it that appeals to me, so it has mostly gone unused.  I recently took the time to build the software that I want for the watch so that I can start wearing it daily, and the result is C64 Watch.

It has a C64 theme and authentic an authentic font.  There is a BASIC interpreter that runs on-device.  It is a version of [TinyBasic Plus](https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus) that I modified to work on the T-Watch.  Initially, I built it with a slide-out on-screen keyboard, but it was such an awful experience with the tiny screen, that I decided to interact with it via a serial terminal.  By plugging the watch into a computer via USB and firing up a terminal, then tapping on the `BASIC` menu option, you can interact with the interpreter in real time.
